*Outlier detection analysis project to identify anomalous consumer behavior based on their spending patterns. The chosen approach is powered by an unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model with a soft-min distance metric, ensuring accurate detection of outliers. The model offers robust explainability through feature-based explanations, providing insights into the factors driving these anomalies.\
